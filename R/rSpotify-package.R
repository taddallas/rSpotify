#' @description Construct a network of the related bands of your favorite bands.
#' Control a Spotify instance from an R session. This package is a silly wrapper
#' to a bash script (https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547) allowing control
#' of Spotify functionality. It's also a bit of Spotify API searching to get the
#' related artists, artist info, etc. It's all in good fun. Feel free to contribute.
