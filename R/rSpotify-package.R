#' @title Control Spotify from R, and programmatically access related artists
#'
#' @description Control a Spotify instance from an R session. 
#' This package is a silly wrapper to a bash script 
#' (https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547) allowing control
#' of Spotify functionality. It's also a bit of Spotify API searching to get the
#' related artists, artist info, etc. It's all in good fun. 
#' Feel free to contribute.
