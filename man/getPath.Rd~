For any number of `steps`, this function finds

\usage{
getPath(startNode, steps = 100, perStep=20, igraphObj=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{startNode}{
The artist to start with, and radiate out from
}
  \item{steps}{
Number of layers to go outward from the input band.  
}
  \item{perStep}{
The number of related bands to examine per artist of interest. See `details` for more information
}
  \item{igraphObj}{
Boolean. Do you want the output as an edgelist or an igraph object?
}

}
\details{
A `steps` value of 0 just finds the most related bands of the input band, while a `steps` value of 1 would examine the most related bands of the input band, and the most related bands of those bands. This gets out of control pretty quickly, so I recommend having some patience and selecting a `steps` value less than 5. 

The number of related bands for a given artist is controlled by `perStep`, which defaults at the max number of bands that Spotify gives you (`perStep = 20`)
}

\value{
An igraph network object or an edgelist. The choice between the two really depends on how you want to visualize/analyze the graph. Check out the `getYourNetwork()` function examples for some cool dynamic network plotting.
